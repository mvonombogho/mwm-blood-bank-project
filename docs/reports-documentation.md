## Troubleshooting

### Export Issues

If you encounter issues when exporting reports:

1. Ensure you have stable internet connection
2. For large reports, try exporting smaller date ranges
3. Make sure you have permission to download files in your browser
4. If exporting to Excel or PDF fails, try CSV format as an alternative
5. Check that you have enough disk space for the downloaded file

### Print Issues

If you encounter issues when printing reports:

1. Make sure your printer is properly connected and has paper
2. Try using a different browser if the print layout appears incorrect
3. For large reports, try printing specific sections or use the export function instead
4. Adjust the scale in the print dialog if content appears too small or gets cut off

### Data Accuracy Issues

If the report data appears incorrect or inconsistent:

1. Verify that the date range and filters are set correctly
2. Check if there are any pending data updates or synchronizations
3. Refresh the report to ensure you have the latest data
4. Contact the system administrator if data discrepancies persist

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reporting**: Generate inventory status reports daily to monitor critical blood levels
2. **Month-End Analysis**: Run monthly donation reports at the end of each month for donor management
3. **Data Verification**: Cross-reference transfusion reports with hospital records periodically
4. **Archive Reports**: Export and save critical reports for long-term record-keeping and compliance
5. **User-Specific Reports**: Create customized reports for different staff roles (e.g., donor coordinators, inventory managers)
